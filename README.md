# bpe (in development)
A C89 standard compliant, single header, nostdlib (no C Standard Library) byte pair encoding without any dynamic memory allocation.

#### What is byte pair encoding:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding

For more information please look at the "bpe.h" file or take a look at the "examples" or "tests" folder.

## Quick Start

Download or clone bpe.h and include it in your project.

```C
#include "bpe.h"

#include "stdio.h" /* Only needed here for demonstrational printf */

int main() {

    char input[] = "abababab";

    bpe model = {0};
    model.text = input;
    model.text_length = BPE_STRLEN(input);

    /* Run until there are no more replacements. 
       Alternativly you can limit it by fixed iteration loop 
    */
    while (bpe_forward(&model))
    {
        /*
          Intermediate Access

          model.most_frequent_pair_count
          model.most_frequent_pair
          model.text
          model.text_length
          model.replacement_symbol
          model.iteration_count
          
        */
    }

    /* Final encoded text*/
    printf("encoded text: %s\n", model.text);

    bpe_decode(&model);

    /* Decode back */
    printf("decoded text: %s\n", model.text);

    return 0;
}
```

## "nostdlib" Motivation & Purpose

nostdlib is a lightweight, minimalistic approach to C development that removes dependencies on the standard library. The motivation behind this project is to provide developers with greater control over their code by eliminating unnecessary overhead, reducing binary size, and enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Many modern development environments rely heavily on the standard library, which, while convenient, introduces unnecessary bloat, security risks, and unpredictable dependencies. nostdlib aims to give developers fine-grained control over memory management, execution flow, and system calls by working directly with the underlying platform.

### Benefits

#### Minimal overhead
By removing the standard library, nostdlib significantly reduces runtime overhead, allowing for faster execution and smaller binary sizes.

#### Increased security
Standard libraries often include unnecessary functions that increase the attack surface of an application. nostdlib mitigates security risks by removing unused and potentially vulnerable components.

#### Reduced binary size
Without linking to the standard library, binaries are smaller, making them ideal for embedded systems, bootloaders, and operating systems where storage is limited.

#### Enhanced performance
Direct control over system calls and memory management leads to performance gains by eliminating abstraction layers imposed by standard libraries.

#### Better portability
By relying only on fundamental system interfaces, nostdlib allows for easier porting across different platforms without worrying about standard library availability.
